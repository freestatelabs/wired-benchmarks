# wired-benchmarks
Multi-language benchmarks for the `Wired.jl` package.

This repository contains benchmarks for Julia, C, Fortran, and Python 
implementations. All code was developed on Apple silicon with MacOS 14.2.1 using: 
* GCC 13.2.0 (for C and Fortran)
* Python 3.11.7 
* Julia 1.10.0

The code is not fully tested on Windows, but it should work just fine.
